Bacteria found in the intestines can produce ammonia. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a very distinct odor. This odor is familiar to many people because ammonia is used in smelling salts, many household and industrial cleaners, and window-cleaning products. Ammonia gas can be dissolved in water. This kind of ammonia is called liquid ammonia or aqueous ammonia. Once exposed to open air, liquid ammonia quickly turns into a gas. Ammonia is applied directly into soil on farm fields, and is used to make fertilizers for farm crops, lawns, and plants. Many household and industrial cleaners contain ammonia.",

Absorption through the eye has been documented. Most of the inhaled ammonia is retained in the upper respiratory tract and is subsequently eliminated in expired air. Almost all of the ammonia produced endogenously in the intestinal tract is absorbed. Exogenous ammonia is also readily absorbed in the intestinal tract. Ammonia that reaches the circulation is widely distributed to all body compartments although substantial first pass metabolism occurs in the liver where it is transformed into urea and glutamine. Ammonia or ammonium ion reaching the tissues is taken up by glutamic acid, which participates in transamination and other reactions. The principal means of excretion of ammonia that reaches the circulation in mammals is as urinary urea; minimal amounts are excreted in the feces and in expired air.",

However, longer-term exposure (10-27 min) to a concentration of 500 ppm resulted in lower retention (4-30%), with 350-400 ppm eliminated in expired air by the end of the exposure period, suggesting an adaptive capability or saturation of the absorptive process. Nasal and pharyngeal irritation, but not tracheal irritation, suggests that ammonia is retained in the upper respiratory tract. Unchanged levels of blood-urea-nitrogen (BUN), non-protein nitrogen, urinary-urea, and urinary-ammonia are evidence of low absorption into the blood. Exposure to common occupational limits of ammonia in air (25 ppm) with 30% retention (and assuming this quantity is absorbed into the blood stream) would yield an increase in blood ammonium concentration of 0.09 mg/L.

The lack of change in blood nitrogen compounds and urinary-ammonia compounds lends further support to a limited absorption into the systemic circulation.

Information on the distribution of endogenously-produced ammonia suggests that any NH4+ absorbed through inhalation would be distributed to all body compartments via the blood, where it would be used in protein synthesis or as a buffer, and that excess levels would be reduced to normal by urinary excretion, or converted by the liver to glutamine and urea. If present in quantities that overtax these organs, NH4+ is distributed to other tissues and is known to be detoxified in the brain. /NH4+/",

											"String": "Human adults produce around 1000 mmol of ammonia daily. Some is reutilized in biosynthesis. The remainder is waste and neurotoxic. Eventually most is excreted in urine as urea, together with ammonia used as a buffer. In extrahepatic tissues, ammonia is incorporated into nontoxic glutamine and released into blood. Large amounts are metabolized by the kidneys and small intestine. In the intestine, this yields ammonia, which is sequestered in portal blood and transported to the liver for ureagenesis, and citrulline, which is converted to arginine by the kidneys. The amazing developments in NMR imaging and spectroscopy and molecular biology have confirmed concepts derived from early studies in animals and cell cultures. The processes involved are exquisitely tuned. When they are faulty, ammonia accumulates. Severe acute hyperammonemia causes a rapidly progressive, often fatal, encephalopathy with brain edema. Chronic milder hyperammonemia causes a neuropsychiatric illness. Survivors of severe neonatal hyperammonemia have structural brain damage. Proposed explanations for brain edema are an increase in astrocyte osmolality, generally attributed to glutamine accumulation, and cytotoxic oxidative/nitrosative damage. However, ammonia neurotoxicity is multifactorial, with disturbances also in neurotransmitters, energy production, anaplerosis, cerebral blood flow, potassium, and sodium. Around 90% of hyperammonemic patients have liver disease. Inherited defects are rare. They are being recognized increasingly in adults. Deficiencies of urea cycle enzymes, citrin, and pyruvate carboxylase demonstrate the roles of isolated pathways in ammonia metabolism. Phenylbutyrate is used routinely to treat inherited urea cycle disorders, and its use for hepatic encephalopathy is under investigation. /Hyperammonemia/",

Growth experiments with high concentrations of ammonia clearly demonstrated that sensitivity to ammonia stress was markedly higher in M. thermophila PT than in the syntrophic co-culture. M. thermophila PT also exhibited higher sensitivity to high pH stress, which indicated that an inability to maintain pH homeostasis is an underlying cause of ammonia inhibition. Methanogenesis was inhibited in the resting cells of M. thermophila PT with moderate concentrations of ammonia, suggesting that the inhibition of enzymes involved in methanogenesis may be one of the major factors responsible for ammonia toxicity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a broad range of disturbances in M. thermophila PT cells under ammonia stress conditions, including protein denaturation, oxidative stress, and intracellular cation imbalances. The results of the present study clearly demonstrated that syntrophic acetate degradation dominated over aceticlastic methanogenesis under ammonia stress conditions, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies on complex microbial community systems. Our results also imply that the co-existence of multiple metabolic pathways and their different sensitivities to stress factors confer resiliency on methanogenic processes.",

											"String": "Recently, spatial-temporal/metabolic mathematical models have been established that allow the simulation of metabolic processes in tissues. We applied these models to decipher ammonia detoxification mechanisms in the liver. An integrated metabolic-spatial-temporal model was used to generate hypotheses of ammonia metabolism. Predicted mechanisms were validated using time-resolved analyses of nitrogen metabolism, activity analyses, immunostaining and gene expression after induction of liver damage in mice. Moreover, blood from the portal vein, liver vein and mixed venous blood was analyzed in a time dependent manner. Modeling revealed an underestimation of ammonia consumption after liver damage when only the currently established mechanisms of ammonia detoxification were simulated. By iterative cycles of modeling and experiments, the reductive amidation of alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) via glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) was identified as the lacking component. GDH is released from damaged hepatocytes into the blood where it consumes ammonia to generate glutamate, thereby providing systemic protection against hyperammonemia. This mechanism was exploited therapeutically in a mouse model of hyperammonemia by injecting GDH together with optimized doses of cofactors. Intravenous injection of GDH (720 U/kg), alpha-KG (280 mg/kg) and NADPH (180 mg/kg) reduced the elevated blood ammonia concentrations (>200 uM) to levels close to normal within only 15 min. If successfully translated to patients the GDH-based therapy might provide a less aggressive therapeutic alternative for patients with severe hyperammonemia. /Hyperammonemia/",

This in silico approach predicted that the enzymes have to be zonated in order to achieve maximal removal of toxic ammonia and minimal changes in glutamine concentration. Using 13 compartments, representing hepatocytes, the following predictions were generated: glutamine synthetase is active only within a narrow pericentral zone. Glutaminase and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase are located in the periportal zone in a non-homogeneous distribution. This correlates well with the paradoxical observation that in a first step glutamine-bound ammonia is released (by glutaminase) although one of the functions of the liver is detoxification by ammonia fixation. The in silico approach correctly predicted the in vivo enzyme distributions also for non-physiological conditions (e.g. starvation) and during regeneration after tetrachloromethane (CCl4) intoxication. Metabolite concentrations of glutamine, ammonia and urea in each compartment, representing individual hepatocytes, were predicted. Finally, a sensitivity analysis showed a striking robustness of the results. These bioinformatics predictions were validated experimentally by immunohistochemistry and are supported by the literature. In summary, optimization approaches like the one applied can provide valuable explanations and high-quality predictions for in vivo enzyme and metabolite distributions in tissues and can reveal unknown metabolic functions.",

One consequence of ammonia action on the brain is astrocyte swelling, which triggers the generation of oxidative/nitrosative stress at the level of NADPH oxidase, nitric oxide synthases and the mitochondria. A self-amplifying signaling loop between oxidative stress and astrocyte swelling has been proposed. Consequences of the ammonia-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress response are protein modifications through nitration of tyrosine residues and oxidation of astrocytic and neuronal RNA. Nitrosative stress also mobilizes zinc from intracellular stores with impact on gene expression. These alterations may at least in part mediate cerebral ammonia toxicity through disturbances of intracellular and intercellular signaling and of synaptic plasticity. Oxidative/nitrosative stress and a low-grade cerebral edema as key events in the pathogenesis of ammonia toxicity and hepatic encephalopathy may offer potential new strategies for treatment. Ammonia-induced oxidation of RNA and proteins may impair postsynaptic protein synthesis, which is critically involved in learning and memory consolidation. RNA oxidation offers a novel explanation for multiple disturbances of neurotransmitter systems and gene expression and the cognitive deficits observed in hepatic encephalopathy.",

											"String": "Mechanisms involved in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) still remain poorly understood. It is generally accepted that ammonia plays a major role in this disorder, and that astrocytes represent the principal target of ammonia neurotoxicity. In recent years, studies from several laboratories have uncovered a number of factors and pathways that appear to be critically involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Foremost is oxidative and nitrosative stress (ONS), which is largely initiated by an ammonia-induced increase in intracellular Ca(2+). Such increase in Ca(2+) activates a number of enzymes that promote the synthesis of reactive oxygen-nitrogen species, including constitutive nitric oxide synthase, NADPH oxidase and phospholipase A2. ONS subsequently induces the mitochondrial permeability transition, and activates mitogen-activated protein kinases and the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). These factors act to generate additional reactive oxygen-nitrogen species, to phosphorylate various proteins and transcription factors, and to cause mitochondrial dysfunction. This article reviews the role of these factors in the mechanism of HE and ammonia toxicity with a focus on astrocyte swelling and glutamate uptake, which are important consequences of ammonia neurotoxicity....",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation. Dataset: the integrated content containing the transformation information. Source: the entity or group that compiled the dataset containing the transformation information.",

													"String": "The major hazards encountered in the use and handling of ammonia stem from its toxicologic properties and reactivity. Exposure to this colorless gas (liquid, if compressed or in aqueous solution) may occur from its use as a fertilizer, chemical intermediate, alkalizer, metal treating/extraction agent, and common household cleaner. Ammonia is hazardous by all routes (ie, dermal, ingestion, inhalation), with the liquid capable of burning the skin, causing permanent eye damage, or corroding the digestive tract upon contact; and the gas capable of causing severe eye damage, pulmonary edema, and even death from spasm, inflammation, and edema of the larynx. OSHA has established an ammonia Permissible Exposure Level (PEL) of 50 ppm as an 8-hr time-weighted average (TWA). The ACGIH recommends an 8-hr TLV-TWA of 25 ppm. Ammonia levels should be controlled through process enclosure and the use of local exhaust and dilution ventilation, as necessary. While its offensive odor may serve as a warning, to assure against ammonia exposure, workers should wear chemical protective clothing composed of butyl rubber, natural rubber, neoprene, nitrile rubber, or polyvinyl chloride (not Viton), gloves, face protection, and, in emergency situations, a self-contained breathing apparatus. Facilities for quick-drenching the body, as well as eye-wash fountains, should be immediately at hand for the worker. Clothing that becomes wet with liquid ammonia should be placed in closed containers until it can be discarded. While this substance does not burn or ignite readily (autoignition temp: 1204 °F), containers of ammonia may explode in the heat of a fire. For small fires involving ammonia, extinguish with dry chemical or CO2, and for large fires, use water spray, fog, or foam, taking care to prevent fire control or dilution water from causing pollution. More hazardous than its fire potential is ammonia's reactivity with halogens, interhalogens, and oxidizers. These reactions may be violent and/or may form explosive products. Ammonia should be stored in a cool, well-ventilated location, away from sources of ignition, and separate from other chemicals, particularly oxidizing gases (chlorine, bromine, and iodine) and acids. Aqueous ammonia is commonly containerized in steel drums. Anhydrous ammonia is stored and shipped (prohibited in passenger planes) in pressurized containers, fitted with pressure-relief safety devices, and bearing the label, \"Nonflammable Compressed Gas\". For small spills of ammonia, isolate 80 feet in all directions from the spill, ventilate the area, and allow vapor or gas to disperse. For large spills, evacuate the area for 160 feet in all directions, and dike to contain the spill for later recovery or disposal and to prevent runoff from causing pollution. Stay upwind and wear positive-pressure breathing apparatus and full protective clothing, as necessary.",

													"String": "Warning: Ammonia is extremely corrosive to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Contact with the liquified gas may cause frostbite. Caution is advised.  Signs and Symptoms of Acute Ammonia Exposure: Inhalation of ammonia may cause irritation and burns of the respiratory tract, laryngitis, dyspnea (shortness of breath), stridor (high-pitched respirations), and chest pain. Pulmonary edema and pneumonia may also result from inhalation. A pink frothy sputum, convulsions, and coma are often seen following exposure to high concentrations. When ammonia is ingested, nausea and vomiting may result; oral, esophageal, and stomach burns are common. If ammonia has contacted the eyes, irritation, pain, conjunctivitis (red, inflamed eyes), lacrimation (tearing), and corneal erosion may occur. Loss of vision is possible. Dermal exposure may result in severe burns and pain.  Emergency Life-Support Procedures: Acute exposure to ammonia may require decontamination and life support for the victims. Emergency personnel should wear protective clothing appropriate to the type and degree of contamination. Air-purifying or supplied-air respiratory equipment should also be worn, as necessary.  Inhalation Exposure: 1. Move victims to fresh air. Emergency personnel should avoid self-exposure to ammonia. 2. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma. If no pulse is detected, provide CPR. If not breathing, provide artificial respiration. If breathing is labored, administer oxygen or other respiratory support. 3. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of an antidote or performance of other invasive procedures. 4. Transport to a health care facility.  Dermal/Eye Exposure: 1. Remove victims from exposure. Emergency personnel should avoid self- exposure to ammonia. 2. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma. If no pulse is detected, provide CPR. If not breathing, provide artificial respiration. If breathing is labored, administer oxygen or other respiratory support.Warning: Do not attempt to neutralize with an acid wash; excessive liberation of heat may result. 3. If eye exposure has occurred, eyes must IMMEDIATELY be flushed with lukewarm water for at least 15 minutes. 4. Remove contaminated clothing as soon as possible. 5. Wash exposed skin areas THOROUGHLY with soap and water. 6. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of an antidote or performance of other invasive procedures. 7. Transport to a health care facility.  Ingestion Exposure:  1. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma. If no pulse is detected, provide CPR. If not breathing, provide artificial respiration. If breathing is labored, administer oxygen or other respiratory support. 2. DO NOT induce vomiting or attempt to neutralize!  3. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of an antidote or performance of other invasive procedures. 4. Activated charcoal does not strongly bind ammonia, and therefore is of little or no value. 5. Give the victims water or milk: children up to 1 year old, 125 mL (4 oz or 1/2 cup); children 1 to 12 years old, 200 mL (6 oz or 3/4 cup); adults, 250 mL (8 oz or 1 cup). Water or milk should be given only if victims are conscious and alert. 6. Transport to a health care facility. (EPA, 1998)",

Readily combines with silver oxide or mercury to form compounds that explode on contact with halogens. When in contact with chlorates it forms explosive ammonium chlorate [Kirk-Othmer, 3rd ed., Vol. 2, 1978, p. 470]. Reacts violently or produces explosive products with fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine and some of the interhalogen compounds (bromine pentafluoride, chlorine trifluoride). Mixing of bleaching powder (hypochlorite solution) with ammonia solutions produces toxic/explosive ammonia trichloride vapors. Undergoes potentially violent or explosive reactions on contact with 1,2-dichloroethane (with liquid ammonia), boron halides, ethylene oxide (polymerization), perchlorates or strong oxidants (chromyl chloride, chromium trioxide, chromic acid, nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide, chlorates, fluorine, nitrogen oxide, liquid oxygen). Reacts with silver chloride, silver oxide, silver nitrate or silver azide to form the explosive silver nitride. May react with some heavy metal compounds (mercury, gold(III) chloride) to produce materials that may explode when dry. [Bretherick, 5th ed., 1995, p. 1553].",

The explosion damaged the western end of the facility and released 26,000 pounds of aqua ammonia (29.4 percent ammonia solution in water), forcing the evacuation of as many as 26 residents and requiring 1,500 people to shelter-in-place. DDW used the vessel in the manufacture of food-grade caramel coloring. It functioned as a feed tank for a spray dryer that produced powdered colorants. The feed tank, which was heated with steam and pressurized with air, was operated manually. To ensure that the filling, heating, and material transfer processes stayed within operating limits, operators relied on their experience and on readouts from local temperature and pressure indicators. The feed tank most likely failed as a result of overheating the caramel color liquid, which generated excessive pressure.",

Maintenance workers replaced the rupture disk on that day; however, the closed isolation valve was not reopened. On the morning of June 11, an operator closed a block valve isolating the ammonia pressure control valve from the heat exchanger. The operator then connected a steam line to the process line to clean the piping. The steam flowed through the heat exchanger tubes, heated the liquid ammonia in the exchanger shell, and increased the pressure in the shell. The closed isolation and block valves prevented the increasing ammonia pressure from safely venting through either the ammonia pressure control valve or the rupture disk and relief valve. The pressure in the heat exchanger shell continued climbing until it violently ruptured at about 7:30 a.m. The catastrophic rupture threw debris that struck and killed a Goodyear employee walking through the area. The rupture also released ammonia, exposing five nearby workers to the chemical. One additional worker was injured while exiting the area. Immediately after the rupture and resulting ammonia release, Goodyear evacuated the plant. Medical responders transported the six injured workers. The employee tracking system failed to properly account for all workers and as a result, Goodyear management believed all workers had safely evacuated the affected area. Management declared the incident over the morning of June 11, although debris blocked access to the area immediately surrounding the heat exchanger. Plant responders managed the cleanup while other areas of the facility resumed operations.",

The hydraulic shock was enabled during the restart of the plant's ammonia refrigeration system following a 7-hour power outage. In addition to the catastrophic failure of roof-mounted piping, the pressure developed by the hydraulic shock event also caused an evaporator coil inside the facility to rupture. The ammonia cloud released from the roofmounted pipe and traveled 0.25 miles across the river adjacent to the plant. Downwind of the ammonia release were crew members on the ships docked at Millard and over 800 contractors working outdoors at a clean-up site for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. One Millard employee sustained injuries after briefly losing consciousness from ammonia inhalation. Nine ship crew members and 143 of the offsite contractors downwind reported exposure. Of the exposed victims, 32 required hospitalization, and 4 were placed in intensive care. ... Approximately 15 minutes after being notified of the release, the Millard Plant Manager called 9-1-1, triggering a response from the Mobile Fire Department (MFD), which arrived on scene 16 minutes later with hazardous materials technicians to assess and mitigate the release. The Theodore Volunteer Fire Department also responded on the south side of the canal. The MFD called the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency and advised shelter-in-place for the surrounding community and the U.S. Coast Guard halted water traffic on the industrial canal. Shortly after the release occurred, contract employees working at the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) vessel and boom decontamination site,7 approximately 0.25 miles south of Millard, became engulfed in the ammonia cloud and immediately started experiencing symptoms of ammonia exposure. The workers were advised to go to their personal cars and evacuate the facility. The Mobile County Fire and Rescue set up an impromptu triage site at a gas station about 2 miles from the DWH clean-up site where exposed workers gathered upon evacuation. Most of the offsite contractors went to the triage site for medical evaluation, and some were transported to the hospital.",

													"String": "An explosion at the Dixie Cold Storage Company in Shreveport, LA occurred as two firemen attempted to isolate an anhydrous ammonia leak in a cold storage warehouse. The men were badly burned when their protective clothing ignited in the ensuing fire, and one died within 36 hr. ... Several days prior to the accident, employees noted a smell of ammonia and located a leak in the refrigeration system. Steps were taken to isolate the system and repair a leaky valve at the evaporator unit. As they were working, ammonia continued to accumulate in the room. The crew tried to absorb the gas using a 50 lb cylinder of carbon dioxide. This has been effective for small amounts of ammonia but was not recommended for large leaks. The carbon dioxide contacted moist room air and condensed. Ammonia also condensed, greatly reducing visibility. The room became untenable for anyone not wearing full protective equipment and workers were using only industrial type filter masks or chemical respirators. They left the room and called the fire department to borrow full protective gear. When firemen arrived, they were told that the leak had been isolated, that it had not been prolonged, and that only residual gas remained. Water was sprayed in the room to absorb the ammonia, and a fan was set up. After considering various alternatives, the firefighters decided to use an electric fork lift truck to replace the valve located 17 ft above the floor. The floor was very slippery, and the truck slid into an interior wall and the concrete curb at its base. Explosion occurred immediately. One firefighter was unable to escape or remove his burning suit. /The situation indicated that/ the warehouse workers' failure to reduce the possibility of hazardous anhydrous ammonia levels, the firefighters' lack of awareness of hazardous gas levels, and ignition of the gas are major factors in loss of life in this accident.",

													"String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Ammonia is a colorless gas or liquid. Ammonia is used in the production of ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate for fertilizers; and in the manufacture of nitric acid, soda, synthetic urea, synthetic fibers, dyes, and plastics. Ammonia, or dissociated ammonia, is used in such metal treating operations as nitriding, carbo-nitriding, bright annealing, furnace brazing, sintering, sodium hydride descaling, atomic hydrogen welding, and other applications where protective atmospheres are required. The petroleum industry utilizes anhydrous ammonia in neutralizing the acid constituents of crude oil and in protecting equipment such as bubble plate towers, heat exchangers, condensers, and storage tanks from corrosion. It is also used as medication. Ammonia in an aqueous environment exists in equilibrium between ionized ammonium cation and the non-ionized ammonia. This equilibrium can be affected by buffers, pH, temperature, and salinity. Thus, in many cases it is not possible to assign the associated toxicity to the ionized or non-ionized form of the ammonia-nitrogen. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Studies using low levels of ammonia show that inhaled ammonia is temporarily dissolved in the mucus of the upper respiratory tract, and then a high percentage of it is released back into the expired air. Following exposure to 500 ppm ammonia for 10-27 min, healthy male subjects eliminated 70-80% of the inspired ammonia by this route. Short term exposure: eye or skin contact with ammonia can cause irritation, burns, frostbite (anhydrous), and permanent damage. Irritates the respiratory tract causing coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Higher exposure can cause pulmonary edema, a medical emergency, that can be delayed for several hours and is life-threatening. Exposure can cause headache, loss of sense of smell, nausea, and vomiting. Inhalation: nose and throat irritation have been reported at 72 ppm after 5 min exposure. Exposures of 500 ppm for 30 min have caused upper respiratory irritation, tearing, increased pulse rate, and blood pressure. Death has been reported after an exposure to 10,000 ppm for an unknown duration. Skin: Solutions of 2% ammonia can cause burns and blisters after 15 min of exposure. These burns may be slow to heal. Anhydrous ammonia may cause skin to freeze. Eyes: Levels of 70 ppm (gas) have caused eye irritation. If not flushed with water immediately, contact with eye may cause partial or complete blindness. Ingestion: ammonia will cause pain if swallowed and burning of the throat and stomach. May cause vomiting. One teaspoon of 28% aqua ammonia may cause death. Long term exposure: repeated exposure can cause chronic eye, nose, and throat irritation. Repeated lung irritation can result in bronchitis with coughing, shortness of breath, and phlegm. Analysis of blood samples from 22 workers exposed to ammonia in a fertilizer factory and 42 control workers not exposed to ammonia showed increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), increased mitotic index (MI), and increased frequency of CAs and SCEs with increasing length of exposure. ANIMAL STUDIES: Analysis of endogenous ammonia levels in the expired air of rats showed concentrations ranging from 10-353 ppb (mean = 78 ppb) in nose-breathing animals. The quantitative difference between inspired and expired ammonia suggests that small amounts are absorbed across the nasopharyngeal membranes into the systemic circulation. Absorbed ammonia is excreted by the kidneys as urea and urinary ammonium compounds, as urea in feces, and as components of sweat. Toxic levels do not develop as a result of chronic inhalation exposure because the body has multiple effective mechanisms for detoxifying and excreting it. Cardiovascular changes that may be analogous to those observed in humans have been observed in rabbits exposed to high concentrations of ammonia. Bradycardia was seen at 2,500 ppm, and hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias leading to cardiovascular collapse followed acute exposures to concentrations exceeding 5,000 ppm. Pathological correlates for these effects have not been demonstrated. Atrophy of pericardial fat has been observed in mice exposed to 4,000 ppm ammonia. Hepatic effects are usually not seen in animals exposed to ammonia gas. Liver necrosis has been observed following acute lethal exposure of mice to 3,440 ppm ammonia for 1 hour. Levels of 170 ppm of ammonia vapor caused mild changes in the spleens, kidneys, and livers of guinea pigs. Static exposures of cats and rabbits for 1 hr at 7000 mg/cu m resulted in the death of approx 50%. Postmortem exam showed severe effects on the upper respiratory tract. Less severe effects in the lower respiratory tract included damage to bronchioles and alveolar congestion, edema, atelectasis, hemorrhage, emphysema, and fluid. The search for the peripheral toxins responsible for the CNS impairment present in hepatic encephalopathy has shown that the administration of ammonia in normal rats reproduced behavioral and electrophysiological changes similar to those seen in galactosamine induced encephalopathy. No statistically significant differences were noted in ovarian or uterine weights of pigs exposed to about 7 or 35 ppm ammonia for 6 weeks. Female pigs that were continuously exposed to about 35 ppm ammonia from 6 weeks before breeding until day 30 of gestation had no statistically significant differences in age at puberty, number of live fetuses, or fetus-to-corpus luteum ratio compared to pigs exposed to only about 7 ppm. No unexposed controls were included in that study. No statistically significant difference in fetal length was evident at 30 days of gestation in offspring of pig dams that were continuously exposed to about 7 or 35 ppm ammonia from 6 weeks before breeding until day 30 of gestation. The mutagenicity of anhydrous ammonia was investigated in a Ames test in S. typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538, and in E. coli WP2uvrA. The test method was modified appropriately to investigate a volatile test substance. Studies were performed in duplicate in the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system. No evidence of mutagenicity was seen under the conditions of this assay. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Ammonia is an environmental pollutant that is toxic to all aquatic animals. The major sources for atmospheric NH3 are agricultural activities and animal feedlot operations, followed by biomass burning (including forest fires) and to a lesser extent fossil fuel combustion. Close to its sources, acute exposures to NH3 can result in visible foliar injury on vegetation.",

A pig herd experiencing clinical problems of M. hyopneumoniae infections was selected. In total, 1095 finishing pigs of two replicates in eight compartments each were investigated during the entire finishing period (FP). Indoor PM10 and NH3 were measured at regular intervals during the FP with two Grimm spectrometers and two Graywolf Particle Counters (PM10) and an Innova photoacoustic gas monitor (NH3). Average daily weight gain (ADG) and mortality were calculated and associated with PM10 and NH3 during the FP. Nasal swabs (10 pigs/compartment) were collected one week prior to slaughter to detect DNA of M. hyopneumoniae with nested PCR (nPCR). The prevalence and extent of pneumonia lesions, and prevalence of fissures and pleurisy were examined at slaughter (29 weeks). The results from the nasal swabs and lung lesions were associated with PM10 and NH3 during the FP and the second half of the FP. In the univariable model, increasing PM10 concentrations resulted in a higher odds of pneumonia lesions (second half of the FP: OR=8.72; P=0.015), more severe pneumonia lesions (FP: P=0.04, second half of the FP: P=0.009), a higher odds of pleurisy lesions (FP: OR=20.91; P<0.001 and second half of the FP: OR=40.85; P<0.001) and a higher number of nPCR positive nasal samples (FP: OR=328.00; P=0.01 and second half of the FP: OR=185.49; P=0.02). Increasing NH3 concentrations in the univariable model resulted in a higher odds of pleurisy lesions (FP: OR=21.54; P=0.003) and a higher number of nPCR positive nasal samples (FP: OR=70.39; P=0.049; second half of the FP: OR=8275.05; P=0.01). In the multivariable model, an increasing PM10 concentration resulted in a higher odds of pleurisy lesions (FP: OR=8.85; P=0.049). These findings indicate that the respiratory health of finishing pigs was significantly affected by PM10.",

The current study examined the possibility that ammonia contributes to the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine (METH). The results show that a binge dosing regimen of METH to the rat increased plasma and brain ammonia concentrations that were paralleled by evidence of hepatotoxicity. The role of peripheral ammonia in the neurotoxic effects of METH was further substantiated by the demonstration that the enhancement of peripheral ammonia excretion blocked the increases in brain and plasma ammonia and attenuated the long-term depletions of dopamine and serotonin typically produced by METH. Conversely, the localized perfusion of ammonia in combination with METH, but not METH alone or ammonia alone, into the striatum recapitulated the neuronal damage produced by the systemic administration of METH. Furthermore, this damage produced by the local administration of ammonia and METH was blocked by the GYKI 52466 [4-(8-methyl-9H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepin-5-yl)-benzamine hydrochloride], an AMPA receptor antagonist. These findings highlight the importance of ammonia derived from the periphery as a small-molecule mediator of METH neurotoxicity and more broadly emphasize the importance of peripheral organ damage as a possible mechanism that mediates the neuropathology produced by drugs of abuse and other neuroactive molecules.",

													"String": "Ammonia is a bi-product of protein metabolism in the body. It is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and elevated ammonia levels are toxic to the brain. Rats with hyperammonemia showed impaired learning ability and impaired function of the glutamate-nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (glutamate-NO-cGMP) pathway in the brain. Chronic treatment with sildenafil restored learning ability. We therefore tested the hypothesis that sildenafil has a protective effect on the brains of hyperammonemic rats. Hyperammonemia was induced in male rats by daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ammonium chloride (100 mg/kg body weight) for 8 weeks. Sildenafil citrate was administered intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg body weight/3 days) for 8 weeks. Treatment with sildenafil resulted in a significant reduction in plasma liver enzymes, lipid profile as well as brain lipid peroxidation and caspase-3 mRNA. Meanwhile, plasma NO as well as cGMP, antioxidants and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene expression were significantly elevated in the brains of hyperammonemic rats. Our results showed that sildenafil exerts a protective effect on the brain by reversing oxidative stress during hyperammonemia and this could be due to (i) cytoprotective, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects (ii) increasing cGMP and enhancing the proper metabolism of fats which could suppress oxygen radical generation and thus preventing oxidative damage in the brain. The exact protective mechanism of sildenafil has to be still investigated ... Consequently, therapeutic modulation of the NO/cGMP pathway might have important clinical applications to improve brain functions in patients with hyperammonemia or clinical hepatic encephalopathy. /Hyperammonemia/",

													"String": "Ammonia is a key toxin in the precipitation of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with liver failure. In response to ammonia, various toxic events are triggered in astroglial cells, and alterations in brain glutamate communication are common. Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound that has been extensively studied in pathological events because it presents several beneficial effects, including some in the central nervous system (CNS). We previously described that resveratrol is able to significantly modulate glial functioning and has a protective effect during ammonia challenge in vitro. In this study, we addressed the mechanisms by which resveratrol can protect C6 astroglial cells from glutamatergic alterations induced by ammonia. Resveratrol was able to prevent all the effects triggered by ammonia: (i) decrease in glutamate uptake activity and expression of the EAAC1 glutamate transporter, the main glutamate transporter present in C6 cells; (ii) increase of glutamate release, which was also dependent on the activation of the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) co-transporter NKCC1; (iii) reduction in GS activity and intracellular GSH content; and (iv) impairment of Na(+)K(+)-ATPase activity. Interestingly, resveratrol, per se, also positively modulated the astroglial functions evaluated. Moreover, we demonstrated that heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), an enzyme that is part of the cellular defense system, mediated some of the effects of resveratrol. In conclusion, the mechanisms of the putative protective role of resveratrol against ammonia toxicity involve the modulation of pathways and molecules related to glutamate communication in astroglial cells.",

End points monitored included subjective and objective measures of eye and throat irritation as well as pulse rate, respiration rate, pulmonary function (FVC, FEV), assessment of neurological function (reflex, balance, and coordination), and body weight. The exposure protocol consisted of a pre-exposure evaluation by a physician, 3 hr of exposure (this conflicts with exposure data on table 2 of the study and mentioned above), a mid-point physician's observation, lunch break, 3 additional hr of exposure, and a third physician's observation 30 min after exposure ceased. The conjunctiva and mucosa of the nose and throat were examined by a physician before and after each daily exposure and the degree of irritation noted was described as mild, moderate, or marked. Exposure to ammonia had no significant effect on the measures of respiratory function or in the neurological tests conducted. The results of the evaluations of irritation conducted by the physician showed no significant differences between the exposure groups, including the 0 ppm exposure group (preexposure). All subjects experienced some watering of the eyes and a sensation of dryness in the nose and throat, and there was one observation of definite redness in the mucosa of the nose after a 6-hour exposure to 100 ppm during which time, there was an excursion to 200 ppm ammonia. No redness was observed in this subject the following morning. Throughout the study, the physician observed 6 cases of eye irritation, 20 of nose irritation, and 9 of throat irritation, and most cases appeared to have occurred the first week of the study during exposure to 50 ppm. It is difficult to determine in this study a no-observed adverse- effect level (NOAEL) or LOAEL for irritation due to the different exposure durations experienced by the subjects.",

To explore a possible influence of habituation on the perception of symptoms, the study group was divided into 30 men who were not familiar with the smell of ammonia, and ten participants regularly exposed to ammonia at the workplace. The perceived acute health symptoms and self-reported changes of well-being were assessed by the German version of a questionnaire of the Swedish Performance Evaluation System (SPES). Personal traits were ascertained with the positive and negative affectivity schedule (PANAS) and the Freiburger Personlichkeits Inventar (FPI). There are significant associations between personal traits and the amount of complaints. Subjects with high positive affectivity report less respiratory and irritative complaints, whereas persons with negative affectivity report significantly more olfactory and respiratory symptoms. In general, the strength of these correlations decreases with higher exposure levels. At ammonia concentration above 20 ppm, these associations were no more statistically significant. During the daily exposures, the score of symptoms did not vary significantly. The perceived intensity of health symptoms and annoyance increased with the concentration of ammonia, while the self-reported dimensions of well-being decreased. Workers familiar with the smell of ammonia vapors reported less symptoms compared to naive subjects ...",

Additional attributes characterizing the acute toxicity of inhaled ammonia were determined during a post-exposure period of 2 weeks. The objective of this study is to further refine the methodology applied to derive Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG) values on potent sensory irritants in a controlled rat bioassay. In the more susceptible male rats the 1- and 4-hr LC50 (LC01) were 12,303 (10,067) and 4923 (4028) mg/cu m, respectively. At sublethal exposure levels the ventilation of rats was about one third of normal breathing. This change in ventilation and inhalation dosimetry was adjusted for Cxt-dependent lethal endpoints whereas sensory irritation-related phenomena were C-dependently adjusted. In summary, the outcome of this study shows that C- and C x t-dependent causes of toxicity need to be appreciated when extrapolating across species with species-specific inhalation dosimetry. It also appears to be indispensable that each exposure metric must be disentangled when translating C x t-dependent lethality and reflexively-induced, sensation-based C-dependent point of departures. For one hour exposure periods, these PODs were derived to be 1500 and 500 ppm, respectively.",

													"String": "/AQUATIC SPECIES/ Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly versatile and unique ubiquitous signaling molecule, and is known to play diverse physiological functions in mammals including those of adaptation to various stresses. The present study reports on the influence of exposure to high external ammonia (HEA) on the production of nitric oxide (NO) and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), that produces NO from l-arginine in the freshwater air-breathing catfish (Heteropneustes fossilis), which is reported to tolerate a very HEA. Some levels of NO were found to be present in all the tissues and also in plasma of control fish, which further enhanced significantly in fishes treated with high concentrations of environmental ammonia (25 and 50 mM ammonium chloride) for 7 days, accompanied by more efflux of NO from the perfused liver. This was accomplished by the induction of iNOS activity in different tissues of fish exposed to HEA, which otherwise was not detectable in control fish. Exposure to 25 mM ammonium chloride also led to a significant expression of iNOS protein in different tissues, followed by further increase at 50 mM ammonium chloride. Further, there was an increase in the expression of iNOS mRNA in ammonia-treated fish, thus suggesting that the expression of iNOS gene under hyper-ammonia stress was probably regulated at the transcriptional level. Immunocytochemical analysis indicated that the expression of iNOS in different tissues was zonal specific and not expressed uniformly throughout the organ. Hyper-ammonia stress also led to activation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappaB (NFkB) in hepatic cells. These results suggest that the activation of iNOS gene under hyper-ammonia stress was probably mediated through the activation of one of the major transcription factors, the NFkB ... /Ammonium chloride/",

Previous studies have predominately focused on mechanisms during acute, short-term exposure. For that purpose Atlantic salmon parr were exposed to four ammonia concentrations between 4 and 1800 umol/L total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), and subjected to two feeding regimes for 15 weeks. Elevated environmental ammonia and full feeding strength caused an initial increase in plasma ammonia levels ([T(amm)]) after 22 days of exposure, which thereafter declined and remained similar to the control animals towards the end of the study ... In conclusion, Atlantic salmon parr adapts to the long-term sublethal ammonia concentrations with increased branchial transcription levels of ammonia and urea transporting proteins and ammonia detoxification in the brain.",

The shrimp (6.37 +/- 1.29 g) were individually exposed to 9 different ammonia and nitrite regimes (ammonia at 0 (control), 0.39, and 1.49 mM combined with nitrite at 0 (control), 0.38, and 1.49 mM) in a 30 ppt saline solution at 22 °C. Hemolymph oxyhemocyanin (OxyHc), protein content, acid-base balance, osmolality, and electrolyte levels were measured in treated shrimp after 48 hr of treatment. Hemolymph OxyHc, protein content, the OxyHc/protein ratio, pH, pCO2, HCO3(-), TCO2, OH(-)/H(+), osmolality, and Cl(-), Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), and Mg(2+) levels were inversely related to the dose of ammonia and nitrite. However, hemolymph pO2 levels directly increased with the ammonia and nitrite concentrations. Following exposure to 1.49 mM ammonia +1.49 mM nitrite, the hemolymph pO2 increased by 89.5%, whereas the hemolymph OxyHc, protein content, OxyHc/protein ratio, pH, pCO2, HCO3(-), TCO2, OH(-)/H(+), osmolality, Cl(-), and Na(+) decreased by 51.2, 28.2, 34.9, 2.9, 51.1, 71.5, 70.8, 42.8, 4.9, 32.1, and 38.6%, respectively, compared with control shrimp.

A 3 x 2 factorial experimental design was conducted with animals exposed to three un-ionized ammonia levels under two dissolved oxygen levels. Experiments lasted for 14 days and ...the life-history traits such as survival, molt, maturation, and fecundity /were recorded/. Results showed that hypoxia significantly decreased survival time and the number of molts of D. similis, whereas ammonia had no effect on them. Elevated ammonia significantly delayed development to maturity in tested animals and decreased their body sizes at maturity. Both ammonia and hypoxia were significantly detrimental to the number of broods, the number of offspring per female, and the number of total offspring per female, and significantly synergistic interactions were detected. Our data clearly demonstrate that elevated ammonia and hypoxia derived from cyanobacterial blooms synergistically affect the cladoceran D. similis.",

													"String": "Ammonia's production and use in fertilizers, as a component of household cleaners, as a refrigerant, in the manufacture of a various compounds and as a microbiocide for controlling algal, bacterial and fungal deposits in influent water systems may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. The application of fertilizer to soil, as ammonia, ammonium compounds, or ammonia precursors (such as urea), is a major source of ammonia release to the atmosphere. Ammonia is released in exhaust emissions from automobiles and in tobacco smoke. Large amounts of ammonia are released to the atmosphere worldwide by domesticated farm animals. Natural sources of ammonia emissions to the atmosphere are volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and the decomposition of nitrogenous compounds arising from microbially-fixed nitrogen. If released to the atmosphere, a vapor pressure of 7500 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates ammonia will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase ammonia will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and nitrate radicals; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 100 and 54 days respectively. Ammonia reacts rapidly in the atmosphere with both sulfuric and nitric acids to form fine particles. The formation of ammonium ions in air can result in incorporation into an aerosol or as part of the ionic mix found in cloud and raindrops. Ammonia itself can dissolve in the water in the atmosphere and form clouds or fog. The half-life for ammonia in the atmosphere has been estimated to be a few days. The reaction with acidic substances in the air results in the formation of ammonium aerosols that can be removed by wet or dry deposition. If released to soil, ammonia may either volatilize to the atmosphere, adsorb to particulate matter, or undergo microbial transformation to nitrate or nitrite anions. Uptake by plants can also be an important fate process. Ammonia at natural concentrations in soil is not believed to have a very long half-life. If ammonia is distributed to soil in large concentrations (such as following an ammonia-containing fertilizer application), the natural biological transformation processes can be overwhelmed, and the environmental fate of ammonia will become dependent upon the physical and chemical properties of ammonia, until the ammonia concentration returns to background levels. If released to water, ammonia may adsorb to sediments or suspended organic material. Transformation of ammonia in water occurs primarily by the microbial processes of nitrification (yielding nitrate and nitrite anions) and denitrification. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant of 1.61X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. In water, ammonia is in equilibrium with the ammonium ion (NH4+), and the ammonia-ammonium ion equilibrium is dependent on the pH. Occupational exposure to ammonia may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ammonia is produced or used. Farmers may be exposed during the application of ammonia-containing fertilizers, or manures high in ammonia content. The general population may be exposed to ammonia via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing ammonia. Low levels of ammonia can occur naturally in food and water. Exposure to the general population can especially occur during use of ammonia-containing household cleaners. People living near farms, cattle feedlots, poultry confinement buildings, or other areas where animal populations are concentrated may also be exposed to ammonia. (SRC)",

In soil, ammonia can serve as a nutrient source for plants, which can be taken up by plants and microorganisms and converted to organic-nitrogen compounds(1). Ammonia in soil can be rapidly transformed to nitrate by the microbial population through nitrification(1). The nitrate formed will either leach through the soil or be taken up by plants or other microorganisms(1). Ammonia at natural concentrations in soil is not believed to have a very long half-life. If ammonia is distributed to soil in large concentrations (such as following an ammonia-containing fertilizer application), the natural biological transformation processes can be overwhelmed, and the environmental fate of ammonia will become dependent upon the physical and chemical properties of ammonia, until the ammonia concentration returns to background levels(1).",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(2), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.4 and 12 days, respectively(SRC). In water, ammonia is in equilibrium with the ammonium ion (NH4+), and the ammonia-ammonium ion equilibrium is dependent on the pH(4). The pKa of ammonia is 9.25(5). The proportion of un-ionized ammonia in water increases with increasing temperature and pH, but decreases with increasing salinity(1). At pH 8.5, the proportion of un-ionized ammonia is approximately 10 times that at pH 7.5 and, for every 9 °C increase in temperature, the proportion of un-ionized ammonia approximately doubles(1). In surface water, groundwater, or sediment, ammonia can undergo sequential transformation by two processes in the nitrogen cycle, nitrification and denitrification, which would produce ionic nitrogen compounds, and from these, elemental nitrogen(4). The ionic nitrogen compounds formed from the aerobic process of nitrification (nitrate and nitrite anions) can leach through the sediment or be taken up by aquatic plants or other organisms(4). Removal of ammonium from water can also occur by adsorption to sediments or suspended organic material(4).",

Gas-phase ammonia is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 100 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.60X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 °C(3). Gas-phase ammonia is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with nitrate radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 54 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.99X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 °C(3). Ammonia reacts rapidly in the atmosphere with both sulfuric and nitric acids to form fine particles(4). In most of the US the majority of aerosol ammonium is associated with sulfate ion(4). Once released into the atmosphere, ammonia is returned to the surface as either gaseous ammonia or as an ammonium ion(4). The ammonium ion can be associated with nitrate, sulfate, or some other anion and incorporated into an aerosol or as part of the ionic mix found in cloud and raindrops(4). Ammonia can dissolve in the water in the atmosphere and form clouds or fog(5). The half-life for ammonia in the atmosphere has been estimated to be a few days; the reaction with acidic substances in the air results in the formation of ammonium aerosols that can be removed by wet or dry deposition(5). Vapor deposition of ammonia from air to surface (to vegetation, soil, etc) also occurs(4). Ammonia does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 100 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of ammonia with night-time nitrate radicals is 5.99X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 °C(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 54 days at an atmospheric concentration of 2.5X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(3). Ammonia does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Ammonia reacts rapidly in the atmosphere with both sulfuric and nitric acids to form fine particles(5). Reaction of ammonia with sulfuric acid or ammonium bisulfate is favored over reaction with nitric acid. In most of the US the majority of aerosol ammonium is associated with sulfate ion(5). Some of the ammonium ions in the atmosphere are oxidized to oxides of nitrogen and nitrate ion, which represents a contribution to the total acidity of rainfall(6).",

The equilibrium for these chemical species can be expressed by the following: NH3 + H2O <=> NH4OH <=> NH4+ + OH-(1). The reaction between ammonia and water is reversible (ammonium hydroxide reverting to ammonia and water)(2). The existence of undissociated ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) in aqueous solution is doubtful although there are indications that ammonia can exist in water in the form of the hydrates(2). Ammonia has a reported pKa of 9.25(3). The proportion of un-ionized ammonia in water increases with increasing temperature and pH, but decreases with increasing salinity(4). At pH 8.5, the proportion of un-ionized ammonia is approximately 10 times that at pH 7.5 and, for every 9 °C increase in temperature, the proportion of un-ionized ammonia approximately doubles(4).",

In highly populated fish breeding plants, where feed left overs, excrement and metabolic waste cause growth disturbances and deficiencies, even though there is an adequate supply of oxygen, nitrogen compounds are the decisive factor. A significant role is played by the undissociated NH3 molecule. ... Experiments were carried out both with and without ventilation and using varying amounts of fish feed. The concentration of NH3, which depends on pH and temperature, was investigated to determine the extent of the oxidative change of NH3 through NO3- during the mineralization process of the feed leftovers. Under the conditions used in the 2 sets of experiments there was hardly any tendency for the pH values in the unventilated experiments to alter and become more alkaline from an ammonification of left over feed. In the experiments using ventilation, the proteins underwent an especially intensive process of decomposition, i.e., they became completely mineralized, and considerable amounts of NH4-N and NH3 N were released. Due to the lack of organic acids, these could not be neutralized and, as a result, the pH value increased.",

Monitoring of hen houses in Taiwan between 2008-2009 detected hen house and exhaust ammonia concentrations of 0.5-12.5 ppm which estimated ammonia emission rates of 0.15-0.42 kg/ammonia/hen/year(5). Ammonia losses in emissions from manure composting ranged from 0.2-15.1 g/kg total solids(6).
